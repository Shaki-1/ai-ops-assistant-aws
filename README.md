# AI Ops Assistant — Automated AWS DevOps Deployment

## Overview

AI Ops Assistant is a cloud-hosted AI-powered troubleshooting platform designed to help system administrators and DevOps engineers analyze logs, identify incidents, and generate troubleshooting recommendations automatically.

The project combines:

- AWS EC2 infrastructure
- Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Nginx reverse proxy
- Node.js backend
- PM2 process management
- AI-powered log analysis using Groq
- Automated HTTPS deployment with Certbot
- Dynamic DNS using DuckDNS

The infrastructure is fully reproducible and can be destroyed and rebuilt automatically using Terraform.

# Automated Deployment Workflow

## 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-ops-assistant-aws.git
cd ai-ops-assistant-aws
```

---

## 2. Configure Terraform Variables

Create or edit:

```text
terraform.tfvars
```

Example:

```hcl
ec2_name       = "ai-ops-assistant"
ec2_type       = "t3.micro"

groq_api_key   = "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"
duckdns_domain = "YOUR_DOMAIN"
duckdns_token  = "YOUR_DUCKDNS_TOKEN"
```

---

## 3. Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Terraform automatically:

- Creates the EC2 instance
- Installs dependencies
- Clones the repository
- Configures Nginx
- Starts PM2
- Configures DuckDNS
- Generates HTTPS certificates

---

# Accessing the Application

After deployment:

```text
https://YOUR_DOMAIN.duckdns.org
```

---

# HTTPS Automation

HTTPS is automatically configured using:

- Certbot
- Let's Encrypt
- Nginx integration

Certificates are generated during deployment.

---

# DuckDNS Integration

DuckDNS is used to provide a free domain name dynamically linked to the EC2 public IP address.

The deployment automatically:

- Updates DNS records
- Configures HTTPS for the domain
- Maintains connectivity after redeployment

---

# PM2 Process Management

The backend is managed using PM2.

Useful commands:

```bash
pm2 status
pm2 logs ai-ops-backend
pm2 restart ai-ops-backend
```

PM2 startup is configured automatically so the backend restarts after server reboot.

---

# Security Practices

## Protected Secrets

Sensitive values are excluded from Git:

- `.env`
- `terraform.tfvars`
- runtime history files

## HTTPS Encryption

All traffic is encrypted using Let's Encrypt certificates.

## Reverse Proxy Protection

The backend is not exposed directly to the internet. All traffic passes through Nginx.

---

# Troubleshooting Guide

## Nginx Errors

Check status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

Check logs:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

---

## Backend Errors

Check PM2:

```bash
pm2 logs ai-ops-backend
```

---

## Terraform Validation

```bash
terraform fmt
terraform validate
```

---

# Development Challenges Solved

During development several production-like issues were identified and resolved:

- EC2 memory instability
- API key authentication failures
- Nginx permission errors
- HTTPS certificate validation problems
- Git ownership conflicts
- PM2 persistence issues
- DNS propagation problems
- Reverse proxy configuration issues

These debugging sessions significantly improved deployment reliability and infrastructure automation.

---

# Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes deployment
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Database persistence
- User authentication system
- Monitoring and alerting
- AWS SSM Parameter Store integration
- Multi-instance scalability

---

# Recovery Workflow

If the EC2 instance is destroyed:

```bash
terraform apply
```

The infrastructure and application stack are rebuilt automatically.

---

# Useful Commands

## Destroy Infrastructure

```bash
terraform destroy
```

---

## View Terraform Outputs

```bash
terraform output
```

---

## SSH into EC2

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/YOUR_KEY.pem ec2-user@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
```
